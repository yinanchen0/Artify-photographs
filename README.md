# Artify-photographs
The idea is to turn a photograph of a scene or a person, and process it to create something that looks more like it has been painted as an artwork, and not a photo.

Objective: “looks more like it has been painted as an artwork, and not a photo.”
    - What do artworks usually look like? What are the key characteristics
    The method should be similar to actual painting process, ans artists do the painting bit by bit with the brush.
Assumptions on how to replicate characteristics of artworks
    - Assumption: using dots or other shapes like rectangles make an image seem more like an art work because art has a “lower resolution”
    - Assumption: using shapes of different sizes and overlaying each other will give it a more realistic look.
- 3 different tests:
    1. Applying Rectangles 
    2. Applying Dots
    3. Combining Dots & Rectangles
