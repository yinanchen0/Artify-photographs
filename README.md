# Artify-photographs
The idea is to turn a photograph of a scene or a person, and process it to create something that looks more like it has been painted as an artwork, and not a photo.

Assumptions
Artworks often show visible strokes and lower detail.
Using dots and rectangles helps mimic painting.
Layering small shapes over large ones gives more realism.

Objective
Create images that appear painted by:
reducing resolution,
using brush-like shapes,
layering shapes of different sizes.

Approach
1. Rectangles
Rebuild the image using colored rectangles.
Mimics large brush strokes.

2. Dots
Rebuild the image using colored dots.
Creates a stippled or pointillism effect.

3. Combined
Layer rectangles (base) and dots (detail).
Produces a richer painterly texture.
